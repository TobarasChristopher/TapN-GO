For the Team Project module of the National College of Ireland, Year 2 Semester 2

WARNING
This project uses the functionality of an online hosted database, called supabase. A website bundler is required to load up the website to use its full functionality, or else the experience will be minimal.

Steps to installing and booting up the website using Parcel.js (Source: https://parceljs.org)

1.Open the terminal, and enter "npm install --save-dev parcel"

2. Once it has installed enter this command, followed by the path of the root file you would like to run

for example

my root file is index.html in the downloads folder, so I put the following command
"npx parcel C:\Users\(userPCnamehere)\downloads\(teamprojectfolder)\src\VenueSelect.html"

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PUT VENUESELECT.HTML AS YOUR ROOT FILE WHEN STARTING THE WEBSITE

once the website is taken online, go to the local ip "http://localhost:1234/VenueSelect.html" to go to the main page.

As I am not experienced in parcel at all, parcel might be unwilling to work with, usually deleting .cache-parcel in C:\Users\(yourPCname)\node_modules\.bin works.

ADMIN PASSWORD LOGIN DETAILS FOR VENUES

Venue One: "ilovesandwiches"
Venue Two: "ilovesteak"
Venue Three: "bananasmoothie"
Venue Four: "cookiecrumble"
Venue Five: "foodrelatedpassword"
Venue Six: "totallyoriginalpassword"

note: Venue One is the only venue to be populated with exisiting menu items as a display, the other venues come with no values present online, so are free to be messed around with.

Enjoy!
